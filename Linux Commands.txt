System Management:
find free memory of system: free
free -m (shows in mb)
cpu information: cat /proc/meminfo
memory information: cat /proc/cpuinfo
see os version: uname -a
find from the executable is running: whereis cmd
show filesystem: df
show diskspace: df -h

networking commands:
ping: check connection status
ifconfig: see own ip
trace route: trace the ping path
curl: access the application from browser

Process Management:
