# EC2 Operations and Concepts

## Volume Management

### Increase the EC2 Volume:
1. Take a snapshot.
2. Increase the volume through the console or CLI.
3. Extend the partition using the `growpart` command.

### Replace Root Volume to Its Launch Status:
1. Navigate to **Actions > Monitor and Troubleshoot > Replace Root Volume**.

### Attach EBS Volume to Multiple EC2 Instances:

### Share Snapshots:
1. Share the snapshot with another account by entering the account ID.

### Accidentally Deleted AMI and Snapshot:
- Recovery options are limited but depend on whether backups or secondary snapshots exist.

## AMI Creation

### Create AMI from ISO:
#### Prerequisites:
- Create an S3 bucket.
- Create a role "vmimport" with the required permissions.

#### Steps:
1. Create an OVA image using any VM tool.
2. Upload the OVA package into the S3 bucket.
3. Create a JSON file with metadata details about the OVA package.
4. Use the `aws ec2 import-image` command to use the image from S3.
5. The AMI will be created and can be seen in the **Private AMIs** section.

## Instance Types

### Instances Used:
- **t2.medium**: Jenkins Master
- **t3a.medium**: Jenkins Master
- **t2.medium**: Jenkins On-Demand Agents
- **t3.medium**: Neptune DB Instance Type
- **m5d.xlarge**: RDS

## EC2 Instance Purchasing Types
1. **On-Demand**: Pay for usage.
2. **Scheduled**: Runs within a specified time window and terminates.
3. **Spot**: Bidding prices, with a grace period for graceful termination.
4. **Dedicated Hosts**: Dedicated physical server.

## EC2 Instance Connection Types

---

## EC2 Fleet
- A group of EC2 instances managed as a fleet.

---

## EC2 Status Checks
- **2/2 Status in EC2:**
  - **System Status Check**: AWS side system provisioning status.
  - **Instance Check**: Startup configuration status.
