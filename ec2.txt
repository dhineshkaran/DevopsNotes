1. Increase the ec2 volume - decreasing the volume doesn't need any instance stoppage. But for increasing the ec2 instance we need to take a snapshot of the existing ec2 and create a ebs volume from there.

2. AMI - instance configuration record as an image. 

3. create AMI from ISO - Export the ISO image into amazon s3 as an ova image.
   Use the aws ec2 import-image command to use the image from s3.
   and Once the AMI is created you can create an ec2 instance from that iso image.

4. what is the instance you have used: m5.2xlarge (3) also worked with t3.xlarge (3).

5. EC2 instance purchasing types - on-demand (pay for usage), scheduled (run only with a specified time window and terminates), spot (bidding prices and with a grace period of time it will be gracefully terminated ), dedicated hosts (dedicated physical server).

6.  instance connection - private instance connected using client manager, and other traditional way is with pem key using ssh commands, ec2 instance connect from browser.

7. ec2 fleet is group of ec2 instances

8. 2/2 status in ec2:
    system status check: AWS Side system provisioning status
    instance check: startup configuration status.

9. how to troubleshoot instance status failure: restart the instance, check startup configuration, check memory and the file system is corrupted.

10. how to import onprem ip into ec2: Bring your own IP addresses (BYOIP) module to get that and you would need self signed key for that.

11. Attach ebs volume to multiple ec2 instance: use ebs multi attach for iops ssd type ebs volumes.

12. Replace root volume to its launch status: Actions, Monitor and troubleshoot, Replace root volume.

13. share snapshots: sharing accounts and enter the account id.

14. Accidently delete AMI and snapshot how to recover: Recycle Bin. But you should create the rule to retain the images.

15.
