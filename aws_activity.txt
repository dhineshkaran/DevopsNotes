1. Create a vpc with public and private subnet:
    - create a vpc
    - create subnet with public and private subnet cidr values in its az
    - update the public subnet to auto assign ipv4 address
    - create IGW and attach to main RT with destination 0.0.0.0 and target IGW you created
    - Associate the public subnet in the route table
    - and if you wish to provide outbound traffic for ec2 instance in private subnet
      - create NAT Gateway with Eip, and create a new RT, with route (destination 0.0.0.0 and target NATgateway)
      - associate the private subnet in this route table
    - create an ec2 instance in private subnet
    - create an ec2 instance in public subnet, as bastion host
    - copy the pem key to bastion hosts and try to login into private instance.
    
 2. Migrate ec2 instance:
    - create image for the ec2 instance
    - This will create a snapshot and using that snapshot an ami will be created
    - use this ami to launch a new instance
    - And while creating new instance check pem key to be used is same as before and ebs volume type, size and iops are same.
    
 3. Migrate RDS instance:
    - create a snapshot for the database
    - and restore the database from the created snapshot
