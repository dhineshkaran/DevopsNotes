Explain connections between customer browser and pods:
    browser - internetgateway - alb (ingress alb) will be bound to a ingress - ingress will route to the service based on the path value - pods

see pod logs

Containerlevel:

check imagename and image pulling is correct, namespace is correct.
check livenessprobes, startup probes

check init containers are launched if used.

Node level:
check nodes are active.
instance is in service in loadbalancer.
login to the nodes and check container logs.

master component: check scheduler, controller are active.
