    Takes backup based on time 

7: How point in time backup works:

8: How many snapshots can be preseved: 100 snapshots

10: Where snapshot will be saved: backend aws s3 bucket not visible to us

11: will db available during backup widow and maintenance window:
    io will be disabled so will not work.

14: Multi available RDS: Primary and secondary (synchronous replication)

15: Read replica vs multi az:


16: Maximum readreplica: aurora 15, other 5 RR

17: Aurora and additional features:

18: How to migrate live DB to RDS:
    DMS

19: Can I use standby database for read and write operation when there is primary db instance is there:
    Node

20: Primary and standby database:

21: How to handle high reads:

    2. Vertical autoscaling
    3. readreplica

22. Monitor Read and write in RDS:
    CW
