1. Create a vpc with public and private subnet:
    - create a vpc
    - create subnet with public and private subnet cidr values in its az
    - update the public subnet to auto assign ipv4 address
    - create IGW and attach to main RT with destination 0.0.0.0 and target IGW you created
    - Associate the public subnet in the route table
    - and if you wish to provide outbound traffic for ec2 instance in private subnet
      - create NAT Gateway with Eip, and create a new RT, with route (destination 0.0.0.0 and target NATgateway)
      - associate the private subnet in this route table
    - create an ec2 instance in private subnet
    - create an ec2 instance in public subnet, as bastion host
    - copy the pem key to bastion hosts and try to login into private instance.
    
 2. Migrate ec2 instance:
    - create image for the ec2 instance
    - This will create a snapshot and using that snapshot an ami will be created
    - use this ami to launch a new instance
    - And while creating new instance check pem key to be used is same as before and ebs volume type, size and iops are same.
    
 3. Migrate RDS instance:
    - create a snapshot for the database
    - and restore the database from the created snapshot

4. Migrate on-prem database into aws: 
    use aws dms service to migrate database into aws.
    you need to create an replication instance
    create an source endpoint of onprem server and target endpoint with rds database with other mandatory details
    create an replication task, you can use % symbol to copy all tables and schema into rds.
    also there is an option to check if the connectivity is successful or not.

5. Steps to look for successful cloud migration:
    a. plan according to business objective
    b. look for security complaince during the process
    c. plan for the cloud migration strategy:
        - lift and shift: moving whole on-prem setup into aws
        - replatform: moving only the needed setup into rds (eg on-prem application using Amazon rds)
        - retain: Analyse for now and revisit later
    d. choose what services we will be using to complete the migration - aws database migration services, aws application migration services, cloud endure.
    e. post-migration activities - ensure to revisit once all steps and data migration is properly done.

6. AWS migration tools:
    AWS Application Discovery Service: 
    AWS Database Migration Service:
    AWS Server Migration Service: Mostly used for hypervisor or VM-based modules using OVA module and agent-less. This will be created as an ami and we can launch an instance with that ami.
    Cloud Endure: Agent-based migration activity.
    AWS Snow Family:
