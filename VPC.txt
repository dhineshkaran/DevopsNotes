VPC CIDR block: should be between /16 (65000 hosts) and /28 (16 hosts), /32 (ip)
VPC CIDer block should be /16 and subnet can greater than that. /24 (256)
routetable: route table has connection configuration between subnets and internet. Each subnet can be in one RT only.

NatGateway: allows instance in private subnet to connect with outside internet.
Create a NatGateway with elasticip attached, place in publicsubnet.
Place your instance in private subnet.
All subnets (regardless of whether they are Public or Private) within the same Amazon VPC can communicate with each other by default.

security group vs NACL:
NACL works at subnet group. should give inbound and outbound rules.
security group works at instance level. has only inbound rules

Connect two different vpc using:
    Transit Gateway
    VPN
    VPC peering
